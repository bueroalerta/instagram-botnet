# unison mode execute the same actions for every bot in parallel
# perfect for relative interactions as like 100 photos of your followers
mode:                                           distributed
# distributed mode execute a part of actions for every bot,
# perfect for scraping in a parallelized way and then return the data
# packaged in a single object, scraped by multiple bots to prevent limitations
# distributed mode has a global state that  keeps track of actions executed
# every bot to not repeat them
